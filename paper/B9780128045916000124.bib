abstract = {In this chapter I address the ethical issues of transborder problems, emphasizing the moral responsibility of decision-makers and the desperate need of new information technologies to help curbing the imminent risk of mass killing of emergent and/or reemergent infectious diseases. First, I present the bare essentials of bioethics, its definitions and key components. Next I address the concept of macroethics, the moral responsibility of nations, international organisms or group of individuals with the power of deciding who will be entitled to receive appropriate treatment or prevention. This contrasts with the classical, but not-yet formalized, concept of Microethics, the moral responsibility of individual agents}
