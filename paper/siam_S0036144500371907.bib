    abstract = { Many models for the spread of infectious diseases in populations have been analyzed mathematically and applied to specific diseases. Threshold theorems involving the basic reproduction number \$R\_{0}\$, the contact number \$\sigma\$, and the replacement number R are reviewed for the classic SIR epidemic and endemic models. Similar results with new expressions for \$R\_{0}\$ are obtained for MSEIR and SEIR endemic models with either continuous age or age groups. Values of \$R\_{0}\$ and \$\sigma\$ are estimated for various diseases including measles in Niger and pertussis in the United States. Previous models with age structure, heterogeneity, and spatial structure are surveyed. }
